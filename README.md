# OLE-TSW Controller

An open-source controller project for **Train Sim World (TSW)** built around the **ESP32 (Lolin32 Lite)** platform.  
It allows reading live data from TSW and controlling multiple train functions through custom hardware and a browser-based configuration tool.

I found a "documentation" to the api here: https://forums.dovetailgames.com/threads/train-sim-world-api-support.94488/

- Live data reading from TSW via HTTP-GET  
- Supports AFB, throttle, train brake, loco brake, lights, wipers and more  
- Easy mapping between TSW values and real hardware controls  
- Works offline, LAN-compatible, and loco-independent

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
1. Flash using **PlatformIO** or **Arduino IDE**  
2. Open Wi-Fi Access Point: `TSW-Controller`  
3. Connect to the Web Interface  
4. use Windows/Enable-TSW6-API-Access.cmd to open the Firewall for the controller
   and setup a proxy to forward api-request to localhost 
   (as it seems, the api cannot be made public on the client)
5. Follow the described steps to get the api-key from your TSW-6 installation
